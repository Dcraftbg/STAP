> Pre-built binaries are currently unavailable as this is still alpha.
Pre-built binaries are going to be included in release. For now you have to build them yourself using cargo or rustc. 

Pre-built binaries carry a risk if they were not distributed by the original source or built by you. Any unexpected behavior is your responsibility, and the original source cannot be held liable for any issues that may arise. If you experience any problems, please contact the distributor directly, build the binaries yourself, or obtain pre-built binaries from the original source.
